# SSSHARE: Sexual & Spiritual Violence Survivor's Healing and Accountability Resource Exchange

## A person's faith and belief system is central in recovery from trauma. When faith leaders perpetrate violence, participate in violence or in a cover-up, when they address violence poorly or not at all, survivors' very belief systems and spirituality is deeply harmed. How can a survivor make meaning of their experiences when their understanding of the world has been turned upside down? 

SSSHARE works closely with survivors of spiritual and sexualized violence to direct them to appropriate resources for holding perpetrators and faith leaders accountable, and to resources for recovery and healing. SSSHARE is available to faith and congregational leaders ready to create spaces of accountability and prevention; families and friends of survivors who are not sure where to turn next, and partners from other faith communities to consult on what practices and methods have proven effective in which contexts.
